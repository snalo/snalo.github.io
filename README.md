My name is **Seun Alo**, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Kentucky**, specializing in **computer architecture and hardware acceleration**. I am currently conducting my research at the [**Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)**](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/research-centers-labs/ucat) laboratory, where I focus on designing **scalable and energy-efficient hardware accelerators** for **Geometric Deep Learning** applications. My work explores innovative dataflows and emerging technologies such as **photonic computing** to enable high-performance, low-power machine learning architectures. In April 2023, I successfully passed my Ph.D. oral qualifying examination, presenting a proposal on **‚ÄúDesign of an Efficient, Scalable, and Flexible Tensor Processing Architecture with Photonic Integrated Circuits.‚Äù**

Prior to my doctoral research, I earned a **Master‚Äôs degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** from the **University of Ibadan**, Nigeria, and a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** in the same field from **Federal University of Akure**. Alongside my academic journey, I gained industry experience working in different engineering positions and finally at Huawei Technologies, where I managed complex technical projects across telecommunications networks and data centers. My experience with **interconnects and high-speed communication systems** sparked a curiosity about how photonic principles could be applied to **optical interconnects and within integrated circuits (PICs)**. That curiosity evolved into **my current research on silicon photonics and unconventional computing architectures, bridging optical communication and on-chip computation**

I enjoy solving challenging system-level problems and working at the intersection of hardware design, machine learning, and emerging technologies.

## Projects
### **Current: Scaling Analog Photonic Accelerators for Integer GEMM Kernels**

This project explores the design and optimization of analog photonic accelerators targeted at byte-sized (8-bit) integer matrix multiplication operations ‚Äî a foundational component in many deep learning applications. The work focuses on achieving high-speed, low-energy multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations by integrating photonic computing elements. Challenges addressed include scaling the photonic hardware while maintaining signal integrity and low power consumption.

### **GLCM-Based Image Texture Analysis**

Implemented a content-based image retrieval system using second-order statistical features derived from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The system evaluates texture information for image classification and retrieval tasks. It improves upon traditional CBIR techniques by leveraging GLCM parameters like contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity.
