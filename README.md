I am **Oluwaseun (Seun) Alo**, a **Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Kentucky**, conducting research at the [**Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)**](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/research-centers-labs/ucat) Laboratory. My work lies at the intersection of **hardware acceleration, photonic computing, and emerging computing architectures**.

Currently, I am designing and evaluating **photonic-based hardware accelerators** for *geometric and deep learning applications*, developing **energy-efficient tensor processing architectures**, and conducting **Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR)** experiments for **spintronic material characterization** toward hybrid **photonic–magnetic computing** systems. My research integrates device-level modeling, dataflow optimization, and system co-design to push the limits of energy-efficient AI hardware.

Before my Ph.D., I worked at **Huawei Technologies Nigeria Co. Ltd**, where I led multi-vendor **network infrastructure and system integration projects**, focusing on hardware reliability, signal optimization, and scalable communication solutions. My professional and research experiences bridge **hardware design, optical interconnects, and computing systems**, motivating my pursuit of next-generation **photonic and neuromorphic accelerators**.
