My name is **Seun Alo**, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the **University of Kentucky**, specializing in **computer architecture and hardware acceleration**. I am currently conducting my research at the [**Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)**](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/research-centers-labs/ucat) laboratory, where I focus on designing **scalable and energy-efficient hardware accelerators** for **Geometric Deep Learning** applications. My work explores innovative dataflows and emerging technologies such as **photonic computing** to enable high-performance, low-power machine learning architectures. In April 2023, I successfully passed my Ph.D. oral qualifying examination, presenting a proposal on **“Design of an Efficient, Scalable, and Flexible Tensor Processing Architecture with Photonic Integrated Circuits.”**

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned a **Master’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** from the **University of Ibadan**, Nigeria in 2019, and a **Bachelor’s degree** in the same field from **Federal University of Akure** in 2014. Alongside my academic journey, I gained industry experience working as a **Service Delivery Project Manager** at **Huawei Technologies Nigeria** from 2017 to 2022, where I led technical delivery operations and stakeholder coordination in large-scale telecommunications projects. Earlier in my career, I served as a **research and teaching assistant** at the University of Ibadan, contributing to research on image retrieval systems and assisting in core undergraduate courses.

Now, as I continue my doctoral studies, I am driven by the goal of bridging the gap between next-generation computing architectures and real-world machine learning applications. My mission is to develop intelligent, efficient, and adaptable systems that meet the demands of tomorrow’s computing challenges.

# 🛠️ Projects
## **Scaling Analog Photonic Accelerators for Integer GEMM Kernels**

This project explores the design and optimization of analog photonic accelerators targeted at byte-sized (8-bit) integer matrix multiplication operations — a foundational component in many deep learning applications. The work focuses on achieving high-speed, low-energy multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations by integrating photonic computing elements. Challenges addressed include scaling the photonic hardware while maintaining signal integrity and low power consumption.

## **GLCM-Based Image Texture Analysis**

Implemented a content-based image retrieval system using second-order statistical features derived from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The system evaluates texture information for image classification and retrieval tasks. It improves upon traditional CBIR techniques by leveraging GLCM parameters like contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity.
